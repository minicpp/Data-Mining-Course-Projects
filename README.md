# Data Mining Course Projects

## Project 1: forest coverage prediction
Trained a classifier to recognize different forest cover type, i.e. the tree that covers the area is determined. Proposed to use multiple ANN classifiers, which could get better result than one ANN classifier. 

## Project 2: text mining
Find subtopics of hashtags in twitter. Hashtag is a topic label to refer the content of the tweet that is created by publisher. By searching a hashtag, you would get massive tweets. The proposed clustering method could discover different subtopics in the search result. This can help users to discover interesting subtopics.
